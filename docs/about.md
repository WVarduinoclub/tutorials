# About

Westview Arduino Club is a club meant to introduce students to programming and hardware.
We hope to allow students to work on projects with each other in a manner that they 
may not have before; forming project ideas together, brainstorming solutions, and more.
Here, regardless of whether you are experienced at programming and hardware or not, 
you'll be able to get help and give help to others in a safe, kind environment.
