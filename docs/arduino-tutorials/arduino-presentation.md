# Arduino Presentation

During the Coronavirus Pandemic, our club hosted arduino programming sessions/presentations on zoom for club members. 
It was super successful, and over the course of 3 months we covered all the basics of arduino programming!
You can find the slide presentation below, or you can copy it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RQd2suPPmmwBLj2-0xolnxu9qFx8pc5ZFsIMAnoh5uQ/edit?usp=sharing). 


A full website-based course will come shortly!
