# Putting it All Together

Alright, now let's put our skills to the test with a quick challenge. 

Write a program that lets the user pick a number between 1 and 100. The program will try to guess the number after 
you tell it whether it's too high or too low. If the player wins the game, they should also be able to play again. It should work something like this:

Here's a hint: 

To allow your program to come up with a random number, `import random` in your code. Then, use `randint()` to 
get a random integer between some 2 numbers:

``` python
import random

random_number = random.randint(0, 10) # a random number between 0 and 10!
```

Try making it in your ide! You can even use this interactive console:
