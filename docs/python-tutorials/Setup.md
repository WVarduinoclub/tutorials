# Python Setup

Learn the basics of python!

### How do I start?
There are two popular ways to run python: on a browser, or locally on your computer.

- On a browser:
    - We recommend [CodeSkulptor](https://py3.codeskulptor.org) because it is easy to use and has lots of available modules (you'll learn about that later!)
    - If you don't like CodeSkulptor, simply look up "web python ide" and something good should pop up.
- On your computer (local):
    - [Install python3](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows)
    - Install an editor that can run python3 i.e. don't use the command line. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) works well.

### What if I'm not in Arduino Club?

- Don't worry about it! Just have fun, and if you like this tutorial, "star" our project on github ðŸ˜Š.

### Can I contribute?
