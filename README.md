### How To Use:

1. Install [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/#getting-started)
2. Install [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)
3. You may need to install [pymdown-extentions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/installation/)
4. You may need to install [pygments](https://pygments.org)
5. Fork the project (remote)
6. Clone the project (local)
7. Make your edits are on the master branch. Please preview them with `mkdocs serve` to save time.
8. Commit the changes to the master branch (you can use an intermediate branch for initial changes just in case). 
9. Push these changes to your remote forked repository. 
10. Submit a pull request for the `master -> master branches`. Please wait for this to be accepted before continuing further.
11. Taking care to __not make any changes__ after committing to master, run `mkdocs gh-deploy` in the root of the 
cloned directory. This will generate a gh-pages branch in the forked/cloned repository. 
12. Push these changes to your remote forked repository.
13. Submit a pull request for the `gh-pages -> gh-pages` branches. When this is approved, your changes should be live!
